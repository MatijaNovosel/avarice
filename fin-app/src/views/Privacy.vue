      <b>Log Files</b>
      Like many other Web sites, Finapp makes use of log files. These files
      merely logs visitors to the site – usually a standard procedure for
      hosting companies and a part of hosting services's analytics. The
      information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP)
      addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp,
      referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. This information
      is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement
      around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses, and
      other such information are not linked to any information that is
      personally identifiable.
